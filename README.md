# AI Route Optimization Decision System

# This project explores ML-driven routing decisions on real OpenStreetMap road networks.

## Overview
# - Built edge-level ML travel-time model
# - Compared ML vs baseline routing behavior
# - Logged routing experiments using SQL
# - Evaluated tradeoffs across time and distance

## Tools
# Python, SQL, OpenStreetMap, graph routing

## Goal
# Study when predictive routing meaningfully changes decisions vs heuristic baselines.
